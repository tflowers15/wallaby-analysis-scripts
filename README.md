# wallaby-analysis-scripts

This repository contains python scripts for measuring structural parameters from HI sources 
detected by WALLABY, downloading mutli-wavelength image cutouts at the HI source positions, 
measuring multi-wavelength photometry and deriving physical quantities (e.g. stellar/HI mass
and star formation rates).

# Documentation

The procedures for downloading/measuring photometry/deriving physical quantities are described in Photometry_Cookbook_vX.pdf. This document also provides a step-by-step guide showing the order and settings in which each python script should be run.
